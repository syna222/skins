    summary: "Thomas arrives alone in the UK from the Republic of the Congo. His family are due to join him in a few days. He finds an abandoned flat on an estate, but little does he know that Johnny White has taken over the empty flats in the block and demands rent from Thomas. Thomas then meets Pandora and Effy at a bus stop. They head back to Effy's, where she discovers her mother having sex with another man. Pandora invites Thomas to her Aunt Elizabeth's for tea and scones. He soon discovers the tea is made from marijuana and offers to sell it to get the money to pay Johnny. The gang agree to help Thomas by selling at a party which turns out to be Johnny's turf. After escaping, the gang give the money they have made to Thomas but Johnny and his cronies turn up. Johnny reminds Cook of the threat he made (he would kill Cook when he saw him again) and snatches the chain from around Cook's neck that Cook took from him in the previous episode. Before Johnny can beat Cook, Thomas steps in and challenges him instead. Thomas wins the challenge by eating chilis. The gang decide to celebrate, but Thomas's mum turns up, and appalled by the ensuing party, sends him back home. The episode ends with Pandora being consoled by Aunt Elizabeth.",
